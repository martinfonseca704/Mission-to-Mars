# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
  Data scientist Robin does freelance astronomy work, and is hopefull to land of position with NASA someday. She spends time visiting sites about space exploration especially the mission to Mars. After realising how much water the red planet may have had in its past, an idea sprang, what if a script that would gather all the information from searches in one location and once gathered it could be shown off to other Astrophiles, eventually get NASA‘s attention. Data must be gathered about the mission to Mars from all over the web and displayed in a central location without speading time gathering the data manually. The plan is to build a web application, scrape new data every time she tells it to with a click of a button now she just needs to prepare data before scraping the data Robin will need to understand how webpages are built this way should be able to write a python script that can navigate the web pages to collect the right information once Robin has all the data she’ll need a place to store it instead of using a SQL database with the structure of rules Robin will use a no-SQL database mongoDB. Here’s why data pulled from the Internet comes in many different forms it’s not always in the neat and tidy tables that SQL requires Mongo is designed for document based databases which suits Robin's needs better. She’ll be downloading tables, paragraphs & images. To put it all together in a web application of her own Robin will need to use Flask app is a web framework that allows her to create a web Application using python and then customize it with HTML and CSS. There was a decision to create a portfolio to showcase the project especially this one she plans to add a link to her portfolio on her résumé so she’s going to use bootstrap to give it extra polish to the site.

## Conclusion
- Used Python & Mongo together to connect to Flask.
- Website was made with lastest mars news, pictures, data table.
- Site was made with sections to emphasize features.
- A button than allows updates on on the website.
- Site works w/ mobile devices.
